# Cervical-Spine-Fracture-Probability-Prediction-using-EfficientNet

Description

1. Import necessary libraries and modules:
   - The script imports various libraries, including ones related to deep learning with Keras, efficientnet, image processing with OpenCV, data manipulation with Pandas, and medical image handling with pydicom.

2. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - It loads data from CSV files, presumably containing information about medical images and their labels.
   - Defines directories for training and testing images.
   - Preprocesses data from DICOM files (a common format for medical images) and converts it into an appropriate format for training a neural network.

3. Data Visualization:
   - Displays some of the loaded medical images using Matplotlib for visual inspection.

4. Data Generators:
   - Defines functions for generating batches of training and testing data.

5. Model Definition:
   - Defines a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras, incorporating the EfficientNetB5 architecture.

6. Model Training:
   - Trains the model on the training data using K-fold cross-validation.
   - It saves the best-performing model based on validation loss during training.

7. Model Testing:
   - Loads the saved best model.
   - Predicts on the test data.
   - Adjusts the predictions according to a mapping from prediction types.
   - Updates the 'fractured' column in the submission DataFrame with the predictions.

8. The script handles exceptions using a `try...except` block, printing traceback information if an error occurs.
